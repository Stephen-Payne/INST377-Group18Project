# United States Congress Search Tool

Our project uses data from Probublica's API on Congress members to help users learn about what goes on in Congress. We have created a site where users can search and filter to find information on Congress members and their activities. This project provides one easy to access location for people to learn about US Congress members.

Our project is geared towards desktop browsers, but also allows mobile users the same functionalities, as long as the user has access to a web browser.
