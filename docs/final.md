## Information Problem

Our project was created to address certain information problems. One of the main information problems we'd like to address with this project is that it may be difficult for people to find information about Congress members. People may not know what to look for if they are interested in learning about Congress. Another issue is that even if a person manages to find information on Congress members, if they are interested in learning about specific Congress members, they may not know where to start in searching. Our third problem to tackle is that it can be difficult to understand what actually goes on in Congress.

## Stakeholders

There are a number of stakeholders involved in this project. These include:
- Anyone interested in learning more about US Congress
- Anyone who wants to look up members of Congress
- Anyone who wants to learn which bills were sponsored by certain members
- Anyone who would like to get more engaged in political processes

In order for these stakeholders to be able to make use of our project, we have designed it to work for web browsers. The focus is on the design of the desktop browser but mobile designs are taken into consideration.

## Data

The data we have chosen to work with for this project comes from [ProPublica's Congress API](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/).
